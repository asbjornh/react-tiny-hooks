# react-tiny-hooks

A small but growing collection of simple hooks for React.js that you could easily type out yourself but you're too lazy üêå.

All the hooks are exposed as separate files, like so:

```js
import useEvent from "react-tiny-hooks/use-event";
```

## Contributing

New hooks or ideas for new hooks are very welcome, as long as they are simple and dependency free!
